Task Description:
Design an interface wherein trainers can be added to a given database along with their domains and level of expertise. Also,
design another interface which stores information such as colleges, necessary domains, level of expertise, number of sessions
and training program date can be entered. Given a set of trainers with different domains & levels of expertise, the 
application has to allocate them to each training program based on area and level of expertise required. Under the condition 
that multiple trainers are available for a particular training program, instead of direct allocation, the list of these 
trainers must be made available for the user to choose from.
